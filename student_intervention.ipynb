The Decision Tree performed as well as any other model while also taking the least amount of time to compute. Based purely on model performance on the data given, I believe the Decision Tree is the right decision as it outperformed the other models. An added benefit of the model is that it takes less computational resources to run, and given our concerns around cost and computational time, the Decision Tree is the logical decision.</font>\n",

The Decision Tree algorithm looks at the input variables of a data set (or features) and looks for the optimal split variable. 'Optimal' in our circumstance would be the variable that best splits students who fail and students who pass. After splitting once, it follows both paths and continues to split. For example, if the algorithm finds that the gender of the students is the best first split, it will go to all female students and decide on the best split for that group. Likewise it will do the same for the male students. Once a 'tree' of optimal split variables is built, future predictions are created by following the tree for a given student.</font>\n",
